# CLOQ research log — every version, insight and work item, with TL;DR and evidence

**TL;DR** — The calibration method (CLOQ) was falsified at v1. The paper is now about *perturbation equivalence*:
judge a compressed agent against the model's own perturbation null. The A6000 multi-model matrix has been running
since 2026-09-28 18:10. The live dashboard is https://claude.ai/artifact/PqFrT9bVufKqdkD43u5c1B.

Paths are relative to the repo root unless they start with `/data/` (cluster only; not in git). Stable ids:
versions `V*`, insights `I*` (iteration-scoped in `docs/insights/`), experiment proposals `E*`, work items `W*`.

## V6 · Insight loop, iteration 1 (2026-09-29, in discussion)
**TL;DR** Four candidates (I1–I4), repositioned against the literature. The per-step margin model is inherited
from Du et al. 2026. Our claims are the closed-loop composition, saturation along δ, a later damage threshold, and
cross-model transfer.
- Candidates: `docs/insights/iter_1_candidates.md`. Scripts: `analysis/insights/iter_1/s0*.py`.
  Outputs: `analysis/insights/iter_1/out/*.json` (snapshot `s00_snapshot.json`, 2026-09-29T01:26Z).
- Literature: `docs/insights/SURVEY.md`, `docs/insights/survey_sweeps/{margins_flips_divergence,compressed_agents_eval_noise,equivalence_null_criteria}.md`,
  `analysis/insights/references_new.bib`.
- Discussion (survey + experiment round 1): `docs/insights/iter_1_discussion.md`. Plan: `docs/insights/EXPERIMENTS.md`.
- Agent roles: `~/.claude/agents/cloq-{insight,survey,experiment,verify}.md` (on the cluster login node).
- **Verifier (iter 1, 2026-09-29 02:36Z):** I1 REVISE (v2: per-decision hazard floor), I2 HYPOTHESIS, I3 HYPOTHESIS (at risk: q8 RTN-W4), I4 HYPOTHESIS with I4a HELD (serving numerics move the canonical score ±8 pp). Also: legacy→a6k2 changed the user simulator (11/20 det tasks), so E5 needs the eager null. `docs/insights/iter_1_verdicts.md`, `docs/insights/LEDGER.md`, scripts `analysis/insights/iter_1/verify/v0{1..4}_*.py`.

## W4 · TP=2 on NVLink pairs only (2026-09-28 20:45 PDT)
**TL;DR** `a6k2_q32_bf16_cal` hung in NCCL init on node005 GPUs 5,6, a cross-switch pair with no NVLink. The runner now
gives 2-GPU tasks only NVLink pairs (0,1)(2,3)(4,5)(6,7), and single-GPU tasks prefer broken pairs. This likely also
explains the earlier node007 TP=2 hangs. Runners on node004–007 were restarted (jobs 49638/49639/49641/49642; node006
is down to 4 GPUs because mg546924 took 4).
- Evidence: `/data/ziyangs/cloq_work/logs/tasks/a6k2_q32_bf16_cal.vllm.log` (stops after `pynccl.py:113`), topology
  from `nvidia-smi topo -m` (NV4 within pairs, NODE/SYS across). Fix: `scripts/a6000/noderunner.py` (allocation).

## W3 · Cross-node determinism incident (2026-09-29, root cause found, fix deployed)
**TL;DR** torch Inductor picked the reduction config for the fused residual+RMSNorm kernel by timing it at compile
time: R0_BLOCK 2048 on node005 vs 4096 elsewhere. The summation order changed, so every token shifted, and vLLM batch
invariance does not cover this. Fix: `TORCHINDUCTOR_DETERMINISTIC=1` plus a numerics canary at every server start.
The whole matrix is re-run as `a6k2_*`; old `a6000_*` runs are kept as a legacy "numerics flavour" null (E5).
- Symptom: `runs/a6000_det_q4_a` (node005) vs `runs/a6000_det_q4_b` (node004): 20/20 tasks and 113/113
  identical-prompt decisions shift; `analysis/insights/iter_1/out/s04_node_floor.json`,
  `analysis/insights/iter_1/exp/e_detshift.py`.
- Kernels are identical across nodes: `/data/ziyangs/cloq_work/numtest.py` (hash `932e7dab8e342639` on node004–007).
- Runtime is not the cause: `analysis/determinism/probe_q4.json`. On node006, cold / warm / concurrent / no-prefix-cache
  all match node004 30/30; eager is a third flavour (A 14/30, B 16/30). Script `scripts/a6000/det_probe.py`.
- Root cause (experiment agent): `analysis/insights/iter_1/exp/e_bestconfig.sh`, `e_server_flavour.py`;
  discussion `docs/insights/iter_1_discussion.md` (Experiment round 1), plan E1–E6 `docs/insights/EXPERIMENTS.md`.
- Fix: `scripts/a6000/env.sh` (flag), `scripts/a6000/worker.py::check_canary`; references in
  `analysis/determinism/canary_{agent,sim}_<model>.json`; per-start log `/data/ziyangs/cloq_work/logs/canary.log`.
- **Fix verified (2026-09-28 20:00 PDT):** `runs/a6k2_det_q4_a` (node005) vs `runs/a6k2_det_q4_b` (node004): 257/257 decisions
  byte-identical (prompt + completion), identical metrics. q30a3 pair 303/303 identical. Canary log
  `/data/ziyangs/cloq_work/logs/canary.log`: sim + q4/q8/q30a3 agents match on every node so far.
- Rerun: `scripts/a6000/make_tasks.py --prefix a6k2`. Old unfinished tasks archived in
  `/data/ziyangs/cloq_work/queue/legacy_v1/`.

## W2 · A6000 matrix running (2026-09-28 18:10 →)
**TL;DR** 5 models × 30 configs + determinism pairs; 110 tasks on node003–007 (38 GPUs). Checkpoints live only in
node RAM disk.
- Plan: `docs/A6000_PLAN.md` §3. Generator: `scripts/a6000/make_tasks.py`. Runner/worker: `scripts/a6000/{noderunner,worker}.py`.
- Live queue: `docs/a6000/QUEUE.md` (snapshot pushed every 30 min); `/data/ziyangs/cloq_work/queue/{todo,running,done,failed}/`.
- Logs: `/data/ziyangs/cloq_work/logs/node_<node>_<job>.out` (runner), `.../logs/tasks/<task>.log` (worker + run_arm),
  `.../logs/tasks/<task>.vllm.log`, `.../logs/sim_<node>_<job>.log` (user simulator).
- Per-run artifacts: `runs/a6000_<model>_<config>/<domain>/{metrics,status,config,environment,model}.json`
  (in git), `decisions.jsonl` / `trajectory.jsonl` (cluster only).

## W1 · Phase 0 + environment (2026-09-28)
**TL;DR** Driver 550 cannot run the pinned cu130 stack, so we built the cu129 builds of the same versions. Code is
model-generic with per-token margins. RTN is bit-identical to v1. Smoke test passed.
- Commits `3313d01`, `724b3dc` (and later). Env notes: `env/README_A6000.md`.
- Smoke test: `/data/ziyangs/cloq_work/logs/smoke/49592.out` (3 retail tasks, 83 s, 35/35 decisions with margins,
  server/local prompt ids identical).
- RTN equivalence check (vectorized vs `cloq/gptq.rtn_quantize_linear`, W8/W4/W3 on q4 layer 0): identical — command
  in session log; code `cloq/compress.py`.
- Node GPU faults: node003 PCI 01:00.0 and E1:00.0 (probe in `scripts/a6000/node.sbatch`; log
  `/data/ziyangs/cloq_work/logs/node_node003_49601.out`).

## V5 · Perturbation null on 4B (4080, 2026-09-28 → 09-29)
**TL;DR** BF16 × 5 nonces; Static / FP-Traj / RTN × 3 nonces; 8k harness. Results arrive with release `data-4080`.
- Script: `scripts/null_rerolls.sh`. Handoff: `docs/HANDOFF_4080_FINAL.md` (when pushed).

## V4 · E4 8k vs 32k context control (4080, 2026-09-28)
**TL;DR** Removing truncation lifts every model by 0.01–0.04 and leaves the ranking almost unchanged, so the main
harness moved to 32k. A W4 checkpoint beats BF16 under both harnesses, which is a live example of re-roll noise.
- Evidence: `docs/PROGRESS_2026-09-28.md` §2 (table); script `scripts/ctx_control.sh`; runs `runs/ctx32k_*`
  (4080; in `data-4080`).

## V3 · Strategy pivot to evaluation science (2026-09-28)
**TL;DR** A 48-agent strategy workflow plus an independent recompute. Flips are decided by the state (AUC 0.93).
Open-loop NLL does not track closed-loop success (|r| ≤ 0.13). Failures are write-dominated. Loops are mostly
agent-side.
- Strategy: `docs/STRATEGY_v2.md`. Recompute: `analysis/coling/RESULTS.md` + `analysis/coling/0[1-5]_*.py`.
- Workflow analyses: `analysis/strategy_v2_workflow/{mechanism,truncation,variance}/` (e.g. `mechanism/res_churn.json`).
- Loop attribution: `analysis/coling/04_loop_attribution.py`. Retired claims / reporting conventions: `docs/PROGRESS_2026-09-28.md` §3.

## V2 · v1: 3 draws × 6 arms (4080, 2026-09-16 → 09-27)
**TL;DR** The six calibration arms cannot be told apart in closed loop (arm permutation p = 0.683 pooled / 0.368
long). The CLOQ method claim is falsified. Draw variance is amplified by the closed loop.
- Evidence: `analysis/v1/FINDINGS_V1.md`, `analysis/v1/REPORT_V1.md`, `analysis/v1/results_v1.json`,
  `analysis/V1_STATUS_2026-09-16.md`, amendments `analysis/amendments/`. Protocol: `docs/PLAN_v1.md`, `configs/frozen_v1.json`.

## V1 · v0: single draw, 4 arms (4080, ≤ 2026-09-16)
**TL;DR** Horizon amplification (short 0.000 vs long 0.189, p = 0.039). Open-loop fidelity does not predict
closed-loop success. Support shifts after the first divergence. FP-Traj +0.121 later proved a false positive
(McNemar p = 0.0195; replication −0.035).
- Evidence: `analysis/FINDINGS.md`, `analysis/REPORT.md`, `analysis/results.json`, `analysis/occupancy_obs.json`,
  figures `analysis/fig2_horizon.png`, `analysis/fig6_openloop_vs_closedloop.png`; false-positive recompute
  `analysis/coling/02_v0_gap.py` → `analysis/coling/RESULTS.md`. Protocol: `docs/PLAN_v0.md`, `configs/frozen_v0.json`.
